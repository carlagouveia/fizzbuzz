# FizzBuzz Variation

Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. 
## Rules
- For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Fizz" 
- For multiples of 5 print "Buzz". 
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary
operators or `else`.

# Requirements
* Maximum of 1 if
* You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary
* You can't use switch ... case
* Unit tests
* You can write the challenge in any language you want.
